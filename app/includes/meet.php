            One half of the dynamic duo that founded Rapport, Abi’s been in the game (so to speak) for a good few years now, never failing to wow clients with conferences and experiential events alike, both here and across the planet. Abi has been lucky enough to have tried her hand in all sorts of sectors, from retail to public sector to Pharma and considers herself a world class event producer – we’re inclined to agree.

            Chris is the other half of the partnership, co-founding Rapport with Abi back in 2007. He swears by his mantra Do Great Things and strives to make the global brands he works with do just that.

            Chris has worked across an eclectic bunch of sectors, including retail, public sector and pharma and no-one would disagree that he has a real passion for what he does, pouring his heart and soul into all his events.

            Lisa joined Rapport with a CV no one could argue with, having previously produced experiential events for global brands such as Audi and Mini. Although this is where her wealth of experience lies, she’s no one-trick pony and has since produced events for Rapport for clients such as Capital One. Lisa’s fire and drive to get to the underlying strategy make her an events-force to be reckoned with.

            Laura’s the central cog in the intricate machine that is Rapport; what would we do without her? Laura provides a helping hand in our design studio, as well as in our events team, being instrumental in pulling together the pre-production on our events. As if that isn’t enough she also keeps all office administrative matters in check and let us tell you she runs a pretty tight ship!
